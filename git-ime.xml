    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

   <para>This is a simple shell wrapper script on
   <command>imediff2</command> to make it work well with
   <command>git</command> command.</para>

   <para>If any local uncommitted change is found on
   <replaceable>file</replaceable>, <command>imediff2</command> is executed
   with HEAD and local version of <replaceable>file</replaceable>.  With
   <command>imediff2</command>, you can select a set of changes to the
   <replaceable>file</replaceable> and to commit it to the git repository as a
   meaningful chunk.  This script repeats this process until all changes are
   committed.</para>

   <para>If no local uncommitted change is found on
   <replaceable>file</replaceable>, <command>imediff2</command> is executed
   with HEAD^ and HEAD version of <replaceable>file</replaceable>.  With
   <command>imediff2</command>, you can select a set of changes to the
   <replaceable>file</replaceable> and to commit it to the git repository as a
   meaningful chunk.  This script repeats this process until all changes are
   committed.</para>

   <para>This <command>git-ime</command> is also useful during interactive
   execution of <command>git rebase -i
   <replaceable>treeish</replaceable></command>.</para>

   <para>Please note this <command>git-ime</command> creates or overwrites
   <replaceable>file</replaceable>.tmp_a and
   <replaceable>file</replaceable>.tmp_b files.  So they should not exist
   before execution of this command.</para>
