.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
Merge two (slightly different) files interactively with a user friendly fullscreen interface in text mode\&.

.PP
Imediff2 shows the differences of given two files (in color if the terminal supports them), lets you scroll the file and toggle changes between old and new version one by one\&. If the 'unresolved' mode is enabled, you can optionally save both versions\&.

.PP
Additionally, if the \fI$EDITOR\fR environment variable is set or if \fB/usr/bin/editor\fR exists and is executable, you can also launch an external editor and manually edit the half\-merged file before saving it, perhaps to resolve the 'unresolved' parts\&.

.PP
Empty lines are shown in reverse colors so you see that you can select them\&. If a line is missing completely from one file, imediff2 displays it as a reversed '?'\&. While it seems to take one line in the editing phase, it is naturally not saved into the output file\&.

.PP
To see a list of keyboard commands, hit h or ? in the editor\&.

.PP
The program exits with status 0 if the changes were saved, 1 if the merging was aborted and 2 if the parameters were invalid\&.
