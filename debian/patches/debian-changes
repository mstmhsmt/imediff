The Debian packaging of imediff is maintained in git, using the merging
workflow described in dgit-maint-merge(7).  There isn't a patch queue
that can be represented as a quilt series.

Currently, imediff is hosted at https://github.com/osamuaoki/imediff.git
(Since I am the upstream.  I will move to salsa.debian.org as the primary)

Seeing the git history in the above repository should give you good
clear perspective what is in the single combined diff of this packge.

If bss is ever uploaded to the Debian, the following may be used.

A detailed breakdown of the changes is available from their canonical
representation - git commits in the packaging repository.  For example,
to see the changes made by the Debian maintainer in the first upload of
upstream version 1.2.3, you could use:

    % git clone https://git.dgit.debian.org/imediff
    % cd foo
    % git log --oneline 1.2.3..debian/1.2.3-1 -- . ':!debian'

(If you have dgit, use `dgit clone imediff`, rather than plain `git clone`.)

A single combined diff, containing all the changes, follows.
