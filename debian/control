Description: interactive full screen 2/3-way merge tool
 Imediff lets you merge two (slightly different) files with
 an optional base file interactively with a user friendly
 single-pane full screen interface on a text terminal. In
 other words, it is an ncurses based replacement for sdiff
 and "diff3 -m".
 .
 The program shows the differences of given files (in color
 if the terminal supports them), lets you scroll up and down
 and toggle changes between the old and new versions of
 the differing hunks one by one.
 .
 Unlike split screen based merge tools, it shows only one,
 partially merged, version of the file at a time, making
 it more "WYSIWYG", perhaps more intuitive for beginners and
 most importantly, suitable for narrow terminals.
 .
 Unlike some other merge tools, imediff not only tries to merge
 by line but also tries to merge by character.  This two step
 merge enables clean merge even when the same line is modified
 in both files as long as changes are not overlapped.
 .
 This also comes with git-ime wrapper script to use imediff
 with git VCS and a support file for git-mergetool.
