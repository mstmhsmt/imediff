Note:

To test each script in this directory, from here you need to run like:

```
 $ export PYTHONPATH=../src
 $ ./_<script-name>
```

There is a convenience script.

```
 $ ./make_new_ref.sh
```

This runs some test script using reference result files.

If you change configuration file format, you need to update data in this
directory.

  * update reference template z_initialize.ref
  * update alternative_imediff.conf to get z_macrotrans.ref to match (except
    new parameters)

Baseline template file for alternative_imediff.conf can be generated by running
the following command start from this directory.


 $ cd ../imediff
 $ export PYTHONPATH=../; ./config.py
 $ mv TEMPLATE.imediff ../test/alternative_imediff.conf.new

You need to make the same kind of key swappings in this
alternative_imediff.conf .

For Debian package building, dh_auto_test isn't run from here.  It looks like a
copy of test/ directory as test and a copy of src/imediff directory as imediff
is created at .pybuild/cpython3_3.9/ where the current directory is moved to.
Notable thing is that when test/ directories are copied, symlinks are copied as files.
